## Project Instructions
* Download project as zip (or command line via git clone).
* open project in Xcode, you will see that assets is highlighted red.
* Go to the shared folder in your finder (under the same directory as the xcode project)
* Go to assets
* Open the zipped file, it will give you a folder of images
* Select all of those images and paste them at the top level of the assets folder 
* Delete the zipped file and the image folder, leaving you only with the images and what was originally there (ie json) in the parent level of the assets folder
* Now drag the assets folder into xcode
* Delete the previous assets folder that was in xcode
* IF your new assets folder on xcode is empty, just select all from the same folder in your finder and drag onto the assets folder on xcode
* Now you should see that assets folder on xcode has all the images and etc
* Run your project.


- GitHub was not allowing us to upload images and place them in the assets folder automatically.
